# RPIArcade v1.0
RPI Arcade with Arduino Uno LED controls and Arduino Leonardo microcontrollers

Have you ever wanted to play Pac-Man or classic fighting games with retro arcade controls? Now you can! This is a portable, 2 player, arcade that runs on an RPI and is controlled by Arduinos. You can play plenty of awesome classic games solo or with friends. Plus, all the electronics(minus the mointor) can fit inside the box making it decently portable. It has adjustable LED buttons with 4 different modes: ON, adjustable brightness via potentiometer, buttons that flash if any are pressed, and OFF. The LEDs are controlled by an Arduino UNO. On the other hand, I use an Arduino Leonardo and the "Keyboard.h" library instead of a generic controller boards for easily customizeable microcontrollers. The "RetroPie" emulator that I am running on the RPI recognizes keystrokes, but if you wanted to use this with other emulators or with Steam games that are not optimized for keyboard, there is also a gamepad library that you can find here: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary.

#How to Build
For the box/container... Build a box. Cut all sides to the dimmensions you would like, drill holes into the top for buttons and joystick, screw and glue the sides together, attach the top board via spring latches, and paint if you would like. For most buttons, installation is as easy as pushing them into the holes you have drilled and twisting on a backing by hand to hold them in place. Screw the joysticks into the top of your box and now it's time for wiring. The joystick in my case is the easiest to connect. There is one wire for ground, and then one wire for, left, right, up, down, in that order. Connect ground to ground, and run the other wires directly to the Arduino Uno pins. Manycheap joysticks are made like this, but make sure you look up the model if it doesnt appear to be working in this way.
