# RPIArcade v1.0
RPI Arcade with Arduino Uno LED controls and Arduino Leonardo microcontrollers

This is a portable, 2 player, arcade that runs on an RPI and is controlled by Arduinos. It has adjustable LED buttons with 4 different modes: ON, adjustable brightness via potentiometer, buttons that flash if any are pressed, and OFF. The LEDS are controlled by an Arduino UNO. On the other hand, I use an Arduino Leonardo and the "Keyboard.h" library for easily customizeable microcontrollers. The "RetroPie" emulator that I am running on the RPI recognizes keystrokes, but if you wanted to use this with other emulators or with Steam games that are not optimized for keyboard, there is also a gamepad library that you can find here: https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary.
